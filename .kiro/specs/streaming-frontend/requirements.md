# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based frontend interface for the fault-tolerant streaming service. The frontend will provide an intuitive user experience for stream key registration, account management, and streaming setup guidance, replacing the current API-only registration process. The interface will integrate with the existing Spring Boot backend services and provide real-time feedback on system health and streaming status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new streamer, I want to easily register for an account and receive a stream key through a web interface, so that I can start streaming without using complex API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for username, email, password, and confirm password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create an account and generate a unique stream key
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL display the stream key with a copy-to-clipboard button
4. WHEN registration fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each field
5. IF the username or email already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want clear instructions on how to use my stream key with popular streaming software, so that I can quickly set up my streaming environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives their stream key THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions for OBS Studio
2. WHEN a user receives their stream key THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions for FFmpeg command line
3. WHEN a user clicks on streaming software tabs THEN the system SHALL show relevant configuration details
4. WHEN a user copies the stream key THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the copy action
5. WHEN a user views instructions THEN the system SHALL display the correct RTMP URL and stream key format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want to see the current health status of the streaming service, so that I know if the system is operational before I start streaming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the current system operational status
2. WHEN the system is healthy THEN the system SHALL show a green status indicator with "Operational" text
3. WHEN the system has degraded performance THEN the system SHALL show a yellow status indicator with details
4. WHEN the system is experiencing failures THEN the system SHALL show a red status indicator with failure information
5. WHEN replica status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display within 30 seconds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want to test my stream connection before going live, so that I can ensure everything is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Test Stream" THEN the system SHALL validate the stream key against the backend
2. WHEN the stream key is valid THEN the system SHALL display a success message with connection details
3. WHEN the stream key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN testing a stream THEN the system SHALL check if the RTMP server is accepting connections
5. IF the RTMP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor user registrations and system health through the web interface, so that I can ensure the service is performing well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display recent user registrations
2. WHEN an admin views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show detailed replica health information
3. WHEN an admin views system metrics THEN the system SHALL display heartbeat monitoring data
4. WHEN system failures occur THEN the system SHALL log and display failover events
5. IF failure simulation is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide controls to manage simulation settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to work seamlessly across different devices and browsers, so that I can access the streaming service from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
2. WHEN a user accesses the site on desktop browsers THEN the system SHALL provide an optimized desktop experience
3. WHEN a user uses the interface THEN the system SHALL work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and feedback
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
